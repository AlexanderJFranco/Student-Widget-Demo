# Student-Widget

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.0.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Information
This code is run in parallel with a json database under watch, so in conjunction to `ng serve` be sure to run the following in a separate terminal as shown in the demo:

`npm install -g json-server`  
`json-server --watch db.json`
